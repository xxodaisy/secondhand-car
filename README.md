# 📊 Second-Hand Car Sales Analytics

Machine Learning + Data Visualization Project.

## 🧩 Summary

A data analytics project exploring second-hand car sales using Python for modeling and Power BI for dashboard visualization. 
The analysis focuses on understanding price drivers, identifying customer/car segments, and evaluating simple predictive models.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Identify key features influencing second-hand car prices.

- Segment cars into meaningful clusters.

- Build a baseline regression model for price prediction.

- Visualize insights with an interactive Power BI dashboard.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

Python: pandas · numpy · scikit-learn · matplotlib/seaborn.

Power BI: interactive visual reporting.

Methods: EDA · Standardization · KMeans Clustering · Linear Regression.

## 🔄 Workflow

### Data Preparation:

- Cleaned dataset and selected core numerical features.

- Standardized features for clustering.

### Exploratory Analysis:

- Distribution analysis and core correlations.

- Explored price variations by year, engine capacity, and mileage.

### Modeling:

- Clustering (KMeans, k=3): budget, mid-range, and performance segments.

- Regression: low R² → dataset lacks key pricing determinants.

### Dashboarding:

- Visualized brand performance, price trends, and cluster segmentation.

## 📈 Key Insights

- Engine capacity and year significantly influence price trends.

- Clear segmentation emerges: budget → mid-tier → high-performance.

- Current features explain only ~5% of price variance → more data needed.

## 💡 Recommendations

- Develop targeted marketing per cluster profile.

- Enhance dataset with vehicle condition, ownership history, and brand factors.

- Use engine capacity + year as primary pricing levers.

## 🧭 Conclusion

This project highlights how machine learning and business intelligence tools can be combined to analyze market behavior in the used-car industry. 
Clustering reveals distinct buyer segments, while regression showcases the limitations of the current dataset—guiding future data collection and strategy design.
